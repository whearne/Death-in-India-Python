# Death in India Data Analysis Project
This project focuses on analyzing death statistics in India using Python. It involves data exploration and visualization to understand trends in population, birth rates, and death rates over time.

Features
Data loading and cleaning using pandas.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on death statistics data, including:
Displaying data summary and structure.
Visualizing distributions of numerical data using histograms.
Visualization of trends in population, birth rates, and death rates using line plots.
Utilizes matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required libraries: pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn
You can install the required libraries using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy seaborn
Installation
Clone the repository or download the script directly:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/death-in-india-analysis.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd death-in-india-analysis
Ensure you have the necessary CSV files (Deathdata.csv and rate.csv) in the same directory as the script.

Usage
Open the script (Death in India.py) in your code editor.

Update the file paths for the datasets (Deathdata.csv and rate.csv) in the script if they are located in different directories:

python
Copy code
df = pd.read_csv('path/to/Deathdata.csv')
rate = pd.read_csv('path/to/rate.csv')
Run the script to perform the analysis:

bash
Copy code
python Death\ in\ India.py
The script will display data summaries and visualizations, including:

Histograms of numerical columns in the dataset.
Line plots showing trends in population, birth rates, and death rates over time.
Visualizations
Histograms: Display distributions of various numerical columns in the death data.
Line Plots: Show population changes and trends in birth and death rates over the years.
